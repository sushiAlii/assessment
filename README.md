## 📌 Task Instructions

1. **Create a New API Endpoint**

   - Add a new API endpoint in `index.js` named:

     ```
     [Name]ApiTest
     ```

2. **Smart Contract Interaction**

   - Select any **pre-deployed** or **public smart contract** (mainnet or testnet).
   
   - Fetch some data (any useful information such as balance, contract state, or public variables).
   
   - The logic should fetch data through your new API endpoint.


3. **Output**

   - The result should be printed to the console.
   - No need for complex UI or data persistence 
   - just demonstrate that the data was fetched successfully.
